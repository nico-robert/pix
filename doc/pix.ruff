        # pix - 2D graphics library
        Tcl/Tk wrapper around [Pixie](https://github.com/treeform/pixie), a full-featured 2D graphics library written in ðŸ‘‘ [Nim](https://nim-lang.org).

        #### Compatibility
        Tcl/Tk 8.6 & 9.0

        #### Platforms
        * MacOS (x64 / arm64)
        * Windows x64
        * Linux x64

        Source distributions and binary packages can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/nico-robert/pix/releases) for the platforms mentioned
        above.

        **Note**: I have mainly tested this package on Windows and MacOs x64 with version *8.6.14* and *9.0.1* of Tcl/Tk, it should work on Linux and
        MacOS arm (I hope so!)

        #### Example
        ```
        package require pix

        # Init 'context' with size + color.
        set ctx [pix::ctx::new {200 200} "white"]

        # Style first rectangle.
        pix::ctx::fillStyle $ctx "rgb(0, 0, 255)" ; # blue color
        pix::ctx::fillRect $ctx {10 10} {100 100}

        # Style second rectangle.
        pix::ctx::fillStyle $ctx "rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)" ; # red color with alpha 50%
        pix::ctx::fillRect $ctx {50 50} {100 100}

        # Save context in a image file (*.png|*.bmp|*.qoi|*.ppm)
        pix::ctx::writeFile $ctx rectangle.png

        # Or display in label by example
        set p [image create photo]
        pix::drawSurface $ctx $p
        label .l -image $p
        pack .l
        ```
        See [examples](./pix-examples.html) folder for more demos.

        #### Documentation
        A large part of the `pix` [documentation](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/nico-robert/pix/blob/master/doc/pix.html) comes from the [Pixie API](https://treeform.github.io/pixie/)   
        and source files. 

        #### API
        ** Currently API tested and supported are : **
        *context*  - This namespace provides a 2D API commonly used on the web.
        *font*     - This namespace allows you to write text, load fonts.
        *image*    - Crop, resize, blur image and much more.
        *paint*    - This namespace plays with colors.
        *paths*    - Vector Paths.
        *svg*      - Parse, render SVG (namespace pretty limited)
